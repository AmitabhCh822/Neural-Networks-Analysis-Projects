# Neural Networks Data Analysis

This repository is a collection of neural network models tailored for data analysis across different domains, including sports performance, wine quality, and medical data. It demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to diverse datasets using Keras and TensorFlow.

## Projects Overview

1. **NFL Combine Performance Prediction**: A model that classifies NFL players based on combine data.
2. **White Wine Quality Prediction**: An MLP-based model for predicting the quality of white wines.
3. **Lenses Medical Data Analysis**: Neural network analysis applied to medical data regarding lenses.

## Datasets

Each project uses a unique dataset:
- `nfl_combine_2014.dat.txt` for NFL Combine performance.
- `whitewines.csv` for the white wine quality assessment.
- `lenses.xlsx` or equivalent for the lenses medical data analysis.

## Tools and Libraries

The projects use various Python libraries, including:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Installation

Clone the repository and install necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone [Your-Repository-URL]
pip install tensorflow pandas scikit-learn numpy
